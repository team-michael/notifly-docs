# Client SDK - SDK Integration Test

This section guides you through testing to ensure the Notifly Client SDK is properly set up.

## 1. User Registration and Event Sending

### 1-1. User ID Registration

- Users are created even without registering a user ID, but registering a user ID allows for distinguishing users.
- Register users using Notifly SDK's `setUserId`.

### 1-2. User Properties Registration

- Register user properties using Notifly SDK's `setUserProperties`.

### 1-3. Event Sending

- Send events using Notifly SDK's `trackEvent`.

## 2. Verifying User Registration and Event Sending

- Log in to the Notifly website and select the project that the test user belongs to.
  - Select the project in which the test user is registered from the top right of the homepage.
- Select the user menu, click on the test user in the user list page to go to the user profile page.
- Verify if the user ID, user properties, and events registered in steps 1-1, 1-2, and 1-3 have been correctly transmitted.

### 5-2. Web Push FAQ

If the web push notification does not arrive as expected, check the most common causes.

#### 5-2-1. Device Permissions

The user must allow notification permissions for the browser on the device (macOS, Windows, etc.).

Example (macOS):

<img
  src={require("./image/macOS_notification_settings.png").default}
  width="500px"
/>
#### 5-2-2. Browser Permissions

The user must allow notification permissions in the browser. The default setting and request method for push notification permissions vary by browser.

Example (Chrome)

<img
  src={require("./image/chrome-granted-example.png").default}
  width="400px"
/>

Example (Edge)

<img src={require("./image/edge-blocked-example.png").default} width="400px" />

Depending on the setup method of the Notifly JS SDK, the default permission request popup may or may not appear. For more details, please refer to [Notifly JS SDK - Registering a Service Worker](http://docs.notifly.tech/ko/developer-guide/client-sdk/javascript-sdk#2-3-service-worker-%EB%93%B1%EB%A1%9D%ED%95%98%EA%B8%B0).

#### 5-2-3. Supported Browser Versions

Notifly sends web pushes through the Web Push Protocol. Please check [Push API - Browser compatibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API) for currently supported browsers and versions.

- For example, web pushes are not supported in Safari versions 15 and below on desktop.

#### 5-2-4. Others

If you encounter any issues, please contact the Notifly team.
